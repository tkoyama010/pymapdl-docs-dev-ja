[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

A place where we automatically deploy the pymapdl Japanese documentation.

This repository is automatically edited by our army of robots on the
GitHub CI service. Changes to the documentation should not be made
here but rather in the [`pymapdl`](https://github.com/tkoyama010/pymapdl)
repository.
